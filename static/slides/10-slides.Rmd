# Producer Behavior

.pull-left[

- How do **producers** decide:
    - which products to produce
    - in what quantity
    - using which resources
    - and for what price? 

- Answers to these questions are building blocks for **supply curves**

# The Basics of Production

.pull-left[

- Nearly all goods must be **produced** before we can exchange and consume them

- .shout[Consumption] is the **destruction** of value to gain utility
    - Consumption is the ultimate goal of all economic activity

- .shout[Production] is the **creation** of value, by transforming *lower*-valued goods (resources, inputs, etc) into *higher*-valued goods (outputs, consumer products, etc)

# The Firm

.pull-left[
- In modern market economies, most production takes place in a legal organization known as .shout[the firm]

- It does not *have* to be this way, and for most of history it was not this way
    - Craft guilds
    - Independent artisans
    - Independent contractors

- Firms exist in the way they do because they are an efficient response to particular problems of economic organization

- For now, we'll sidestep this interesting issue, you can take my Industrial Organization course next semester to learn more!

- We will assume that "the firm" is the agent we want to model

- How would we set up an optimization model:

1. **Choose:** .blue[ < some alternative >]

2. **In order to maximize:** .green[< some objective >]

3. **Subject to:** .red[< some constraints >]

- Not true for all firms

# Who Gets the Profits? I

.pull-left[
$$\pi=\underbrace{pq}_{revenues}-\underbrace{(wl+rk)}_{costs}$$

- .whisper[The firm's costs are all of the factor-owner's incomes!]
    - Landowners, laborers, creditors are all paid rent, wages, and interest, respectively

- Profits are the .whisper[residual value] leftover after paying all factors

- Profits are income for whomever is the .shout[residual claimant] of the production process (i.e. **owner/s** of a firm):
    - Entrepreneurs
    - Shareholders

# Who Gets the Profits? II

.pull-left[
$$\pi=\underbrace{pq}_{revenues}-\underbrace{(wl+rk)}_{costs}$$

- Residual claimants have incentives to maximize firm's profits, as this maximizes their own income

- Entrepreneurs and shareholders are the only participants in production that are *not* guaranteed an income!
    - Starting and owning a firm is inherently risky!

# A Peek Inside the Corporate Veil I

.pull-left[

- While the largest category of firms have a *sole proprietor*, .shout[corporations] have many owners (shareholders)

- Many owners cannot possibly coordinate production: choose .shout[managers] to run day-to-day production in exchange for a salary

- One of the key differences in modern large firms is the **separation of ownership and control**

# Profits and Entrepreneurship: A Preview

.pull-left[

- In markets, production must face the .shout[profit test]
    - **Is consumer's willingness to pay $>$ opportunity cost of inputs?**

- Profits are an indication that **value is being created for society**

- Losses are an indication that **value is being destroyed for society**

- Survival for sellers in markets *requires* firms continually create value and earn profits or die

# Industrial Organization: A Roadmap I

- Begin with one extreme case: .shout["perfect competition"]
  - Firms can choose to sell as much $q^*$ as they want
  - Firms are constrained to sell at the (exogenous) market price $\bar{p}$

- Appropriate for settings with *many* firms, each small relative to market

---

# Interlude

- After we find firm's **optimal decisions** in this market (and have Exam 2), we will then finally look at **market equilibrium**

- Put Supply and Demand together
    - We've started to see the origins of how consumers cause and respond to market changes (changes in $p_x$, $p_y$, $m$, etc.)
    - We're about to explore how producers cause and respond to market changes
    - Finally we can explain these market changes with Supply and Demand models

- Discuss how markets work, why they are good and efficient, and when they are not a good idea

---

# Industrial Organization: A Roadmap II

- Examine another extreme case: .shout[monopoly] of a single seller
    - Appropriate for some markets

- More realistic .shout["imperfect competition"]: models of .shout[monopolistic competition] and .shout[oligopoly]
    - In latter case, firms can act **strategically**, so we will introduce <span class="shout">game theory</span>
    
- In all of these cases, firms can choose *both* output $q^*$ and price $p^*$ to maximize $\pi$
