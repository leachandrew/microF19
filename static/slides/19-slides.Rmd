# The Model is Not the Reality II

.pull-left[

- Our models so far have given us interesting results, 
  - Markets reach equilibrium
  - Economic profits are zero in the long run in competitive markets

- Both are **fictional**

- But the models **still** show us useful insights about how a market economy works

- Some readings in today's readings page to help you understand

# How Markets Get to Equilibrium I

.pull-left[

- Nobody knows "the right price" for things

- Each Buyer and Seller only knows **their own** reservation prices

- Buyers and sellers adjust their bids/asks 

- Markets do not *start* competitive, but monopolistic!

- New entrepreneurs enter to try to capture gains from trade/innovation

- As these gains are exhausted, prices converge to equilibrium

# How Markets Get to Equilibrium III

.pull-left[

- Consider the economy as a cat-and-mouse game between two sets of variables:
    - **"Underlying variables"**: preferences, technology, and resource availability

- Induced variables always chasing underlying variables
    - Underlying variables always changing
    - Any time underlying and induced variables are *different*, profit opportunities

- **IF** underlying variables froze, market would rest at equilibrium

# Welfare Economics

- The .shout[1st Fundamental Welfare Theorem]: markets in competitive equilibrium maximize allocative efficiency of resources and are Pareto efficient

- Markets are great when they: 

1. Are .whisper[Competitive]: many buyers and many sellers

2. Reach .whisper[equilibrium]: absence of transactions costs or policies *preventing prices from adjusting* to meet supply and demand

3. .whisper[No externalities] are present: costs and benefits are fully internalized by the parties to transactions 

- If any of these conditions are not met, we have .shout[market failure]
    - May be a role for government, other institutions, or entrepreneurs to fix
