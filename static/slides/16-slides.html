# Returning to Firms I

.pull-left[
- Recall: firms convert some goods to other goods: 

- **Inputs**: `\(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n\)`
  - &lt;span class="green"&gt;**Examples**: worker efforts, warehouse space, electricity, loans, gasoline, cardboard, fertilizer, computers, software programs, etc&lt;span&gt;
  
- **Output**:&lt;sup&gt;.red[1]&lt;/sup&gt; `\(q\)`
  - &lt;span class="green"&gt;**Examples**: oil, cars, legal services, mobile apps, vegetables, consulting advice, financial reports, etc&lt;span&gt;

# Returning to Firms II

.pull-left[

- Suppose a firm sells output `\(q\)` at a price `\(p\)`

- It can buy each input `\(x_i\)` at an associated price `\(p_i\)`
    - labor `\(l\)` at wage rate `\(w\)`
    - capital `\(k\)` at rental rate `\(r\)`

- Profit `\(\implies\)` improving the (total) value of resources
    - bought inputs at some total cost
    - sold as final product at some market price

# Factor Markets

- Recall a firm uses technology that buys inputs, transforms them, and sells output
`$$q=f(k,l)$$`
    - We classified inputs into the **factors of production ("factors")**: land, labor, capital

- We previously *assumed* fixed prices for factors (e.g. `\(w\)` and `\(r\)`)

- Where do these prices come from? .shout[Factor markets]

---

# Supply and Demand in Factor Markets

.pull-left[

- The price of a factor is governed by the same market forces as output: Supply and Demand

- .red[Supply of Factor]: willingness of factor owners to accept and sell/rent their services to firms
  - landowners, workers, capitalists, resource owners, suppliers

- .blue[Demand for Factor]: willingness of firms to pay for factor services

# Factor Market Prices and Opportunity Costs

.pull-left[

- In functioning factor markets, .onfire[the factor price represents the **opportunity cost** of hiring a factor for an alternative use]
  - Firms not only pay for direct use of a factor, but also indirectly for *not using* it in an alternate process!

- .green[**Example**]: a producer of hammers buys steel, pays (the opportunity cost) for "taking" the steel away from alternative uses

- .green[**Example**]: e.g. salary for a skilled worker must be high enough to keep them at their current firm, and not be attracted to other firms/industries

# Labor Markets

.pull-left[
- Empirically, about 70% of total cost of production comes from labor

- We'll focus just on the .shout[market for labor] as an example factor market

- Can do the same for *any* factor market 
  - (e.g. capital, land, materials, etc.)

# Derived Demand in Factor Markets

- Demand for inputs is a **derived demand**:
    - Firm only demands inputs to the extent they contribute to producing sellable output

- Firm faces .whisper[tradeoff] when hiring more labor, as more labor `\(\Delta L\)`:
    1. **Marginal Benefit**: Increases output and thus revenue
    2. **Marginal Cost**: Increases costs

---

# Marginal Revenue Product

- Hiring more labor increases output (i.e. labor's **marginal product** `\(MP_l\)`)&lt;sup&gt;.red[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

--

- Additional output generates **marginal revenue `\(MR\)`**&lt;sup&gt;.red[2]&lt;/sup&gt;

--

- Hiring more labor, on the margin, generates a benefit, called the **marginal revenue product of labor `\((MRP_L)\)`**&lt;sup&gt;.magenta[3]&lt;/sup&gt;:
`$$MRP_L=MP_L* MR(q)$$`
    - i.e. the number of new products a new worker makes times the revenue earned by selling the new products
    
.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;.red[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Recall `\(MP_L=\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta L}\)`, where `\(q\)` is units of output

&lt;sup&gt;.red[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Recall `\(MR=\frac{\Delta R(q)}{\Delta q}\)`, where `\(R(q)\)` is total revenue

&lt;sup&gt;.red[3]&lt;/sup&gt; To maximize distinction between marginal *revenue* product `\(MRP_L\)`, the marginal product of labor, `\(MP_L\)` is sometimes called the marginal *physical* product of labor `\((MPP_L)\)`

# Marginal Revenue Product for Competitive Firms

.pull-left[

`$$MRP_L=MP_L* MR(q)$$`

- For a firm in a competitive (output) market, firm's `\(MR(q)=p\)`, hence

`$$MRP_L=MP_L*p$$`
where `\(p\)` is the price of the firm's output

- Marginal benefit of hiring labor, `\(MRP_L\)` falls with more labor used
    - production exhibits diminishing marginal returns to labor

- Choke price for labor demand: price too high for firm to purchase any labor

# A Competitive Factor Market

&lt;img src="16-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="504" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="16-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="504" /&gt;
]

- If the factor market is competitive, labor supply for an individual firm is *perfectly elastic* at the market wage

---

# Labor Supply and Firm Demand

.pull-left[

- We've seen a falling `\(MRP_L\)`, the marginal benefit of hiring labor

- Marginal cost of hiring labor, `\(w\)`, remains constant
  - so long as firm is not a big purchaser in the factor market

# Labor Supply and Firm Demand

- At low amounts of labor, marginal benefit `\((MRP_L) &lt; w\)` marginal cost

- Firm will hire more labor

# Labor Supply and Firm Demand

.pull-left[

- Firm hires `\(L^*\)` optimal amount of labor where `\(w=MRP_L\)` `\((MB=MC)\)`

- Equivalently (rearranging): `\(MR=\frac{w}{MP_L}\)`
  - implies that firm's producing the profit-maximizing output `\(q^*\)` means firm is using the optimal amount of labor `\(L^*\)`

# Example

.content-box-green[
.green[**Example**]: Victoria’s Tours is a travel company that offers guided tours of nearby mountain biking trails. Its marginal revenue product of labor is given by `\(MRP_L = 1,000 – 40l\)`, where `\(l\)` is the number of tour-guide weeks it hires and `\(MRP_L\)` is measured in dollars per tour-guide week. The going market wage for Victoria’s Tours is $600 per tour-guide week.

]

1. What is the optimal amount of labor for Victoria’s Tours to hire?

2. At and above what market wage would Victoria’s Tours not want to hire anyone?

3. What is the most labor Victoria’s Tours would ever hire, given its marginal revenue product?

# Economic Rent I

.pull-left[

- Recall .red[supply] is the **minimum willingness to accept**, the minimum price necessary to bring a resource to market

- But all (equivalent) labor is paid the market wage, `\(w^*\)` determined by market labor supply and labor demand

- Some workers would have accepted a job for less than `\(w^*\)`

- Labor earns .shout[economic rent] in excess of what is needed to bring it into the market (its opportunity cost)

# Economic Rent II

.pull-left[

- Consider a factor (such as land) for which the supply is perfectly inelastic (e.g. a fixed supply)

- Then the **entire value of the land is economic rent**!

- .whisper[The *less* elastic the supply of a factor, the *more* economic rent it generates!]
