# The Model is Not the Reality I

.pull-left[

- This course is about economic modeling and formal theory

- Applications in electives (this semester):
  - Industrial Organization
  - Labor Economics
  - Public Economics

- Models help us *understand* reality, but they *are not* reality!
  - Don't mistake the map for the territory itself

# The Model is Not the Reality II

.pull-left[

- Our models so far have given us interesting results, 
  - Markets reach equilibrium
  - Economic profits are zero in the long run in competitive markets

- Both are **fictional**

- But the models **still** show us useful insights about how a market economy works

- Some readings in today's readings page to help you understand

    - There are possible gains from trade or gains from innovation to be had
    
- .onfire[Entrepreneurship]: recognizing profit opportunities and entering a market as a seller to try to capture gains from trade/innovation

# How Markets Get to Equilibrium I

.pull-left[

- Nobody knows "the right price" for things

- Each Buyer and Seller only knows **their own** reservation prices

- Buyers and sellers adjust their bids/asks 

- Markets do not *start* competitive, but monopolistic!

- New entrepreneurs enter to try to capture gains from trade/innovation

- As these gains are exhausted, prices converge to equilibrium

# How Markets Get to Equilibrium III

.pull-left[

- Consider the economy as a cat-and-mouse game between two sets of variables:
    - **"Underlying variables"**: preferences, technology, and resource availability
    - **"Induced variables"**: market prices, least-cost technologies

- Induced variables always chasing underlying variables
    - Underlying variables always changing
    - Any time underlying and induced variables are *different*, profit opportunities

- **IF** underlying variables froze, market would rest at equilibrium

- Keeps intuitive appeal of Pareto but more practical
    - Every Pareto improvement is a KH-improvement (but not the other way around!)
    
- Consider policies where winners' maximum WTP `\(&gt;\)` losers' minimum WTA

# Welfare Economics

- The .shout[1st Fundamental Welfare Theorem]: markets in competitive equilibrium maximize allocative efficiency of resources and are Pareto efficient

- Markets are great when they: 

1. Are .whisper[Competitive]: many buyers and many sellers

2. Reach .whisper[equilibrium]: absence of transactions costs or policies *preventing prices from adjusting* to meet supply and demand

3. .whisper[No externalities] are present: costs and benefits are fully internalized by the parties to transactions 

- If any of these conditions are not met, we have .shout[market failure]
    - May be a role for government, other institutions, or entrepreneurs to fix

- **Prices are never "given"**, prices **emerge** dynamically from negotiation and market decisions of entrepreneurs and consumers

- **Competition**: is a **discovery process** which *discovers* what consumer preferences are and what technologies are lowest cost, and how to allocate resources accordingly
