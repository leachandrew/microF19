Your firm can use labor $l$ and capital $k$ to produce output according to the production function:
$$q=4lk$$


The marginal products are:

$$\begin{aligned}
MP_l &=4k \\
MP_k &=4l \\ \end{aligned}$$

Suppose you  need to produce 144 units, the price of labor is \$10, and the price of capital is \$40. 

### 1. What is the least-cost combination of labor and capital that produces 144 units of output?

### 2. How much does this combination cost?

### 3. Does this technology experience constant returns, increasing returns, or decreasing returns to scale?
