You can get utility from consuming Burgers $(b)$ and Fries $(f)$, according to the utility function:

$$u(b,f)=\sqrt{bf}$$

The marginal utilities are:

$$\begin{aligned}
MU_b&=0.5b^{-0.5}f^{0.5}	\\
MU_f&=0.5b^{0.5}f^{-0.5} \\ \end{aligned}$$

You have an income of $20, the price of Burgers is $5, and the price of Fries is $2. Put Burgers on the horizontal axis and Fries on the vertical axis.

### 1. What is your utility-maximizing bundle of Burgers and Fries?

### 2. How much utility does this provide?
