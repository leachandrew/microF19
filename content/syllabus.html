</span></span> is a collection of analytical tools for modeling and understanding how decisions made by agents (individuals and firms) in a context of market institutions lead to social coordination and the creation of value. This toolkit is the analytical foundation for exploring <em>all</em> fields and applications of economics as a social science, has many practical applications in business, finance, politics, and insights into any realm of human endeavors. Economics, after all, is the study of human action. At the intermediate level, these concepts are made more rigorous through the use of mathematical models, but we will first and foremost lay the theoretical foundations with economic intuition. As such, this class assumes you have met the <strong>required prerequisite courses</strong> by taking introductory economics<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">ECON 205, 206<br />

<h2 id="course-objectives">Course objectives</h2>
<p>This class will add rigor to your thinking about the world by empowering you with the ability to model the choices and interactions of people and organizations in their economic capacities – as consumers, producers, firms, voters, etc.</p>
<p><span class="newthought">By the end of this course,</span> you will:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>apply the tools of microeconomics (constrained optimization and equilibrium) towards explaining real world phenomena</li>
<li>apply models of rational choices for individual and firm behavior</li>
<li>identify key features of various market structures (perfect price competition, monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition</li>
<li>understand the role of market institutions of property rights, prices, and profit and losses in bringing about social coordination</li>
</ol>
<p>Given these objectives, this course fulfills all three of the learning outcomes for <a href="https://www.hood.edu/academics/departments/george-b-delaplaine-jr-school-business/student-learning-outcomes">the George B. Delaplaine, Jr. School of Business</a> Economics B.A. program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use quantitative tools and techniques in the preparation, interpretation, analysis and presentation of data and information for problem solving and decision making […]</li>
<li>Apply economic reasoning and models to understand and analyze problems of public policy […]</li>
<li>Demonstrate effective oral and written communications skills for personal and professional success[…]</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="newthought"></span> <strong>Economics is hard.</strong> <em>This, in particular, may be of the hardest courses that you will take, primarily due to the mathematical content.</em> Using the economic way of thinking is a skill, it is literally retraining your brain to interpret and analyze the world in a novel way, and is not something that can be memorized. I will do my best to make this class intuitive and helpful, if not interesting. If at any point you find yourself struggling in this course for any reason, please come see me. Do not suffer in silence! Coming to see me for help does not diminish my view of you, in fact I will hold you in <em>higher</em> regard for understanding your own needs and taking charge of your own learning. There are also a some fantastic resources on campus, such as the <a href="http://www.hood.edu/campus-services/academic-services/index.html">Center for Academic Achievement and Retention (CAAR)</a> and the <a href="http://www.hood.edu/library/">Beneficial-Hodson Library</a>.</p>

<p>These grades are firm cutoffs, but I do of course round upwards (<span class="math inline">\(\geq 0.5\)</span>) for final grades. A necessary reminder, as an academic, I am not in the business of <em>giving</em> out grades, I merely report the grade that you <em>earn</em>. I will not alter your grade unless you provide a reasonable argument that I am in error (which does happen from time to time).</p>
<h2 id="policies-and-expectations">Policies and Expectations</h2>
<h4 id="attendance-and-participation">Attendance and Participation</h4>
<p>I expect you to attend class and to come having already done the reading assigned for that day. I will remind you in class and possibly through Blackboard or email which readings I want you to read for the next class. You are all adults and I will treat you as such. I do not take attendance, nor do I grade formally for participation but I strongly recommended you attend class and participate for your sake and the sake of your classmates. If you are too distracted or are not prepared to learn, I suggest you stay home, where you can check Facebook more efficiently. I reserve the right to boost the final grades of students that I believe have made consistent, quality contributions above and beyond their peers in class conversations by up to 2.5 points.</p>
<h4 id="absences-and-make-ups">Absences and Make-Ups</h4>
<p>You generally do <em>not</em> need to let me know if you are unable to make class, <em>unless</em> it is on the day of an exam. It will however, be your responsibility to acquire the notes from a classmate for any missed classes. If you are unable to attend an exam for a legitimate reason (e.g. sports/club events, traveling, illness, family issues), please notify me at least <em>one week</em> in advance, and we will schedule a make-up exam date. If you are ill or otherwise unable to attend on the day of the exam, contact me ASAP to make arrangements. Failure to do so, including desperate attempts to make arrangements only <em>after</em> the absence will result in a grade of 0 and little sympathy. I reserve the right to re-weight other assignments for students who I believe are legitimately unable to complete a particular assignment.</p>
<h4 id="email-accounts">Email Accounts</h4>
<p>Students must regularly monitor their Hood email accounts to receive important college information, including messages related to this class. Email through the Blackboard system is my main method of communicating announcements and deadlines regarding your assignments. <strong>Do not reply to the automated Blackboard email</strong>. My Hood email (<a href="mailto:safner@hood.edu" class="email">safner@hood.edu</a>) is the best means of contacting me. I will do my best to respond within 24 hours. If I do not reply within 48 hours, do not take it personally, and <em>feel free to send a follow up email</em> in case I genuinely missed your original message.</p>
<h4 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h4>
<p>I am generally in my office Monday-Thursday during “normal business hours.” You are always welcome to walk-in and chat about class, college, careers, or whatever you like. Please try to use the official office hours stated at the head of the syllabus if possible. If you need to meet at a different time, I request that you send me an email or let me know after class so I know when to expect you. If you want to go over material from class, please have <em>specific</em> questions you want answered.</p>
<h4 id="enrollment">Enrollment</h4>
<p>Students are responsible for verifying their enrollment in this class. The last day to add or drop this class .</p>
<h4 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h4>
<p>Hood College has an Academic Honor Code which requires all members of this community to maintain the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity. Cheating, plagiarism, lying, and stealing are all prohibited. All violations of the Honor Code are taken seriously, will be reported to appropriate authority, and may result in severe penalties, including expulsion from the college. See <a href="http://hood.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2016-2017/Catalog/The-Spirit-of-Hood/The-Academic-Honor-Code-and-Code-of-Conduct">here</a> for more detailed information.</p>
<h4 id="accessibility-and-students-with-disabilities">Accessibility and Students With Disabilities</h4>
<p>This course is intended to be accessible for all students, including those with mental, physical, or cognitive disabilities, illness, injuries, impairments, or any other condition that tends to negatively affect one’s equal access to education. If at any point in the term, you find yourself not able to fully access the space, content, and experience of this course, you are welcome (and not required) to contact me by email, phone, or during office hours to discuss your specific needs. I also encourage you to contact the Office of Accessibility Services (301-696-3421 or <a href="mailto:gmuer@hood.edu" class="email">gmuer@hood.edu</a>). If you have a diagnosis or history of accommodations in high school or previous postsecondary institutions, Accessibility Services can help you document your needs and create an accommodation plan. By making a plan through Accessibility Services, you can ensure appropriate accommodations without disclosing your condition or diagnosis to course instructors.</p>
