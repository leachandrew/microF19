<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Today we cover the third effect: the (own) price effect, aka the law of demand: how changes in a goodâ€™s (own) price affect quantity demanded for that good. We introduce the idea of demand functions, inverse demand functions, and a demand curve. I will also show you examples of how we derive demand functions and curves.</p>
<p>The other major concept today is breaking apart the law of demand into two effects: the (real) income effect, and the substitution effect. We considering them conceptually and graphically. These can be a difficult concept for students to grasp.</p>
