# Overview

We begin with an overview of constrained optimization models and our first application, how individuals choose. Our primary focus will be people as consumers - how do they choose to spend their money and how do those choices change? While we will focus extensively on consumers making purchasing choices, do not think this is the only use of this type of model! Today we will cover the *constraints* in the model.

## Utility Functions and PMTs

Two utility functions $u(\cdot)$ and $w(\cdot)$ represent the same preferences iff there is a *strictly* increasing function} $f$ such that $w(\cdot)=f(u(\cdot))$

$$\begin{aligned}
a&=(1,2)\\
b&=(2,2)\\
c&=(4,3)\\
\end{aligned}$$

The following utility functions express the same preferences:

| $u(\cdot)$ | $w(\cdot)$ |
|------------|------------|
| $u(a)=1$   | $v(a)=2$   |
| $u(b)=2$   | $v(b)=4$   |
| $u(c)=3$   | $v(c)=6$   |

$$w(\cdot)=2\left[u(\cdot)\right]$$

A **positive monotonic transformation (PMT)** transforms quantities such that the rank order of the quantities is preserved.

- e.g. $w(u)=u+2; w(u)=4u; w(u)=u^3; w(u)=ln(u)$

*Any PMT of a utility function contains the same preferences!*
