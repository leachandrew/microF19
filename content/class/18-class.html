</ul>
<p>These are examples that I wrote in R/Shiny in the past, to visualize what it is we are looking at. As I find more time, I will update these and integrate them into our slides, but until then, I will just post links.</p>
<p>The first is a visual example of a market supply and demand in equilibrium. You can adjust the slopes (and intercepts) of each curve, which will change the market equilibrium, each curveâ€™s elasticity at equilibrium, and the amount of surplus in equilibrium (and it will calculate each for you).</p>
<p>The second is a visual example of how taxes alter market surpluses. Based on the elasticity of the curve in equilibrium, a tax will both shift some of that surplus to the government (as tax revenue), and some of it is thrown away as <strong>deadweight loss</strong>. The curve with a <em>lower elasticity</em> bears more of the tax burden and loses more surplus. Think of elasticity as the ability to evade the tax - a more elastic curve has more options and will change their buying/selling behavior <em>a lot</em> to a price change (from a tax), and thus will bear less of the tax burden!</p>
