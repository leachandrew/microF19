# Overview

Today we put all of our tools together thus far to solve the consumer's constrained optimization problem. To solve the problem the "traditional way" would be to use [Lagrangian multipliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier) and calculus and solve for the first order conditions. We instead will find the solution by looking graphically, and use an algebraic rule that should make intuitive sense.

# Practice Problems

Today you will be working on [practice problems](/practice/065-practice.html). Answers will be posted later today (along with last classes' problems answers).

# Assignment: Problem Set 1

Problem set 1 (will be) posted shortly, and is due by Thursday September 19 (for section 1 - TuTh) or Monday September 23 (for section 2 - MW)^[Section 1 is one full class ahead of Section 2 due to Labor Day, sorry!]

# Math Appendix

Check back here later for an example of how to solve the constrained optimization problem using calculus methods.
