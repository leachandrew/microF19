<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Solving a single constrained optimum problem might be useful in certain contexts, but the <em>dynamics</em> of change are more interesting: how do people optimally respond to changes in constraints? The remaining few classes before Exam 1 are about how people respond to changes in prices and income. If we can describe this set of behaviors in an equation and graphically, it is the origin of a demand curve.</p>
<p>Today, we look at how changes in <em>income</em> or changes in the prices of <em>other</em> goods can affect your quantity demanded for a good.</p>
<p>In doing so, we also introduce a major empirical tool that we will return to many times: an <em>elasticity.</em> You’ve seen one elasticity before: the price elasticity of demand, and probably calculated it using the “midpoint formula.” There’s a lot more to elasticity (and a lot of other kinds of elasticities!) than that. We will see two varieties today, and will spend most of a lecture on price elasticity, two class periods from now.</p>
