<p>Promoters of a major college basketball tournament estimate that the demand for tickets for <em>adults</em> and by <em>students</em> are given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
q_a&amp;=5,000-10p_a\\
q_s&amp;=10,000-100p_s\\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> represents adults and <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> represents students. They estimate that the marginal and average total cost of seating an additional spectator is constant at $10.</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="question-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 1</h2>
<p>The promoters wish to segment the market and charge adults and students different prices.</p>
<div id="part-a" class="section level3">
<h3>Part A</h3>
<p>For each segment of the market, find the inverse demand function and marginal revenue function.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-b" class="section level3">
<h3>Part B</h3>
<p>Find the profit-maximizing quantity and price for each segment.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-c" class="section level3">
<h3>Part C</h3>
<p>How much total profit would the tournament earn if they could price discriminate?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="question-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 2</h2>
<p>Now suppose they could not price discriminate, and were forced to charge the same price for all attendees.</p>
<div id="part-a-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Part A</h3>
<p>Find the total market demand function.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-b-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Part B</h3>
<p>Find the inverse demand function for the total market, and then the marginal revenue function.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-c-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Part C</h3>
<p>Find the profit-maximizing quantity and price for the whole market.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="part-d" class="section level2">
<h2>Part D</h2>
<p>How much total profit would the tournament earn if they could not price discriminate?</p>
</div>
